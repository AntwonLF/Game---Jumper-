# Game---Jumper- && Technologies:
Jumper" is a festive 2D side-scrolling game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game boasts a dynamic theme that changes throughout the year to celebrate various holidays. In its current state, it's set in a snowy Christmas wonderland. The player takes control of a character, possibly embodying Santa Claus, symbolized by a circular image gracefully moving across the canvas.

# Why---Jumper:
I chose to create "Jumper" seeking the challenge of initially developing Angry Birds. After careful consideration, I opted for a variation inspired by Flappy Bird, culminating in the unique creation that is my brainchild. "Jumper" stands out not just for its entertaining gameplay but also for its versatility. The capacity to adapt its theme for diverse holidays adds an extra layer of excitement for players. Whether it's the snowy charm of Christmas or the vibrant hues of other celebrations, "Jumper" ensures a delightful journey through the seasons.
