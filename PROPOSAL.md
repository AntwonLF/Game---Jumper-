# Project Proposal 

## Project Choice 

- [ ] Circle Jump

## Project Description 

Introducing "Jumper," my gaming application where players engage in an exhilarating challenge of leaping over oncoming obstacles. The scoring system increments with each successful jump until the player collides with another structure, signaling the end of the game. Users can choose to restart and relish a new game. I aspire to enhance the user experience by incorporating improved animations and even introducing artificial intelligence for an added layer of difficulty.

## User Stories

#### MVP Goals

- As a player, I desire the ability for my character (represented by a circle) to perform jumps.
- As a player, I prefer obstacles to appear in various sizes, adding an element of unpredictability to the game.
- As a player, clear indication of the game's conclusion due to colliding with an obstacle is important.
- As a player, I seek a prominently displayed score, providing visibility into my highest level of achievement.
- As a player, the option to effortlessly restart the game upon completion is a convenience I appreciate.

#### Stretch Goals

- As a player, I desire an immersive experience with a sound effect accompanying each collision between my character and an obstacle.
- As a player, I seek to enhance the gaming atmosphere with the addition of soothing lofi music playing in the background.
- As a player, I value a competitive edge, and therefore, I wish for the game to retain and showcase the top three players' scores before initiating a new session.
